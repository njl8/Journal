## What I did today

### Exercises with nature
- Today I went out into the woods behind my house and just enjoyed the calm and quiet out there. It was a pretty Walden esque environment and I enjoyed being out there quite a bit. Walking the woods of my family home brought me back to my childhood and I made a bit of a connection with the kind of stuff Thoreau talks about in Higher Law. Specifically, the way children act in nature versus how an adult appreciates it.
