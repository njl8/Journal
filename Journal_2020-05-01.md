## What I did today

### Quite a bit.

- I worked on our group project and established some good connections within the text.
- It ocurred to me how relevent Walden's passages about isolation are at this time.
- In line with how Walden connects to my life, I recorded a song today. The folk song I wrote myself is about taking what life has to throw at you and remaining positive in spite of it.
- What Walden says about the connections we as people have to music and nature are becoming particularly relevent now.
