## The 2nd Blogpost

### Ideas
When it comes to my second blogpost, I wanna make something good to offset how late I'll be submitting it. In order to make it worth the wait for the fans there are a couple of routes I'm thinking about going down with it.

- Parallells between Thoreau's engineering background and his worldview. This is one I think will be good, after speaking with Professor Schacht this seemed to be an idea he thought worthwhile.
- The concept of isolation within Thoreau's world and how it reflects his values. This could be worked into the previous, but it draws close to overlapping with my first blogpost so anything on this will be scarce.
- Talking about Thoreau's philosophy as it pertains to the law, I've been writing about similar topics in my law class and while it's fresh in my mind I could draw some solid connections.
- Establish an analogy between the government and a machine when talking about Thoreau's worldview. This ties into the first idea and it's something I want to roll with.
