## What I did today

### Coordination with group on final project
- Today I worked with my group in order to get our project ready for publication. In doing so, I looked over our chapter and added a few comments which pertain to the general ideas we're writing about in our blogpost. I added a bit in the way of quotation to support our claims and had Mitchell's support in spell checking my work. He made some revisions to the language which overall makes the post read smoother and corrected some punctuation mistakes I made. The overall quality of our post and its imbedded timeline I think will be far better now that everyone is getting involved in their own ways. In finishing out my other courses, I can now focus primarily on our project and making sure its the best that it can be. I owe it to my group who has worked hard with each other to make our project a good one, especially Danielle.
