## The 2nd Blogpost *Finished*

### 
- I decided to go with the idea Professor Schacht had proposed about considering Thoreau as an engineer and comparing his pencil making to his worldview. Overall, I found far more than I expected to be able to write about this once I actually got to doing so.

## Things I learned
- In doing research about Thoreau I learned about his pencil making process and what it entailed to a greater extent.
- Thoreau used a method known as the Cont√© process, or rather, a similarly derived process of his own invention.
- The pencils Thoreau made were exceptionally better than those previously available in America. Pencils before Thoreau's innovation were smudgy and dulled quickly.
- Thoreau's pencils were considered as good if not better than those of English make, considered the gold standard for pencils at the time.
- I think what's most interesting about this story is that it supports and further elucidates what we already know about Thoreau anecdotally. The man really didn't have interest in material things to all that great an extent. His willingness to abandon fortune and success as a man of industry lends itself to the believability of his worldview.
- There can be a connection between how we make pencils and how we choose to live and out outlooks on life.
