## What I did today

### Relaxation
- With my group project finalized, I read the slack conversation in order to make sure that there was nothing left to do. Other than integrating our timeline into the blogpost as per the guide on canvas there isn't anything left for us to do as a group. Overall, I'm pleased with the way the project turned out and I think it's a good thing that we had a group project. I was initially worried that people wouldn't contribute evenly but having the workload distributed amongst us probably made things a lot easier on me. I was able to finish a project for my other class as a result of being free in that regard.
