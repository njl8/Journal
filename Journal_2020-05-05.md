## Group Work

### Thoughts
- Today I took a closer look at the section on higher laws so that I can contribute more meaningfully to my groupwork.
- I was very apprehensive to be involved in group work over the quarantine. I still am, but my group has been very willing to coordinate and work together throughout the process so far. If anything, I'm the weakest link at this current time in terms of contributions though we are just starting off. I'll make sure to correct this and do a better job so that I don't let down the people I've been paired with. I'll start tonight by making some comments in our group discussion and putting some more thought toward our timeline.
