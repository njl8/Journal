## What I did today

### Comments to do with group blog post

- I worked on our group project and established some more good connections within the text to what we're talking about with regard to the revision timeline. In particular, I took note of some quotes which support our current line of discussion around the concept of higher laws. With regard to the kind of natural state Thoreau believes man exists in, I found one particular quote which I think goes very well with our discussion topic. "Thus, even in civilized communities, the embryo man passes through the hunter stage of development". Thoreau believes you can take the man out of nature, but you can't take the nature out of the man. It's the observations Thoreau makes about his own behavior and lines such as this which make for some interesting points of revision. It seems as though in the final draft of Walden, Thoreau omits some recountings of his own personal experience with his animal tendencies. This has been the most interesting part of Walden to analyze thus far for me.
