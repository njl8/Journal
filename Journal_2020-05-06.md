## Group Work

### Progress
- Today I worked on my group project, I'm handling the blog post we'll be posting and I've been picking up my weight in that regard. I focused on the revisions to the section of Higher Laws with focus on the topic of Thoreau's connection to nature. I'm framing the first section of my post around the quotations we pulled together as a group. In particular, I wrote about the contrast between the language commonly used throughout Walden and the passages where Thoreau describes his desire to hunt. That passage is particularly interesting to me personally as I think Thoreau's philosophy is the right one for a hunter to have. He hunts out of necessity and believes in perserving nature at every turn. Overall, I'm enjoying writing about this particular subject
