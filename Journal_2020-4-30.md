## Things I Did Today

### Review
- Group Project
- Coordinated with my group via slack in order to hear their thoughts on which revisions we would like to use, as those are due tomorrow.
- Read the Higher Laws chapter, as per Danielle's recommendation. It's is a great choice and I'd be glad to lock that in as what we decide to go with.
- I also like Former Inhabitants and Winter Visitors and the revisions towards the end of Walden are interesting.

### Thoughts
I was apprehensive at first about the idea of group work. Seeing how active and responsive people have been has made me feel better about it.
