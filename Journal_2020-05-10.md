## What I did today

### Finalized Blog Post
- Today I finished the blogpost and I feel I contributed the vast majority to it. Danielle's timeline contributions and specific points made it much easier to form my thoughts around what the importance of our revision tracking is. I chose to focus on the dynamic between drafting a text and the changes we undergo as people. I think the comparison made for a good way to conceptualize what these revisions show. The changes and developments we undergo as people are reflected within the things we create over time. I'm overall satisfied with my contributions to our group project though I wish I had been able to help Danielle more with the timeline before she finalized it. Nevertheless, writing nearly the entirety of this blogpost has helped me feel as though I'm pulling my weight within the group.
